-->1. What is a Jenkinsfile? (Very Simple Explanation)

A Jenkinsfile is a text file that tells Jenkins what to do step-by-step.

It is like a recipe for CI/CD.

-->It contains instructions such as:

How to take code from GitHub

How to build it

How to test it

How to deploy it

How to run shell commands

How to create Docker images

How to notify after success/failure

➡️ Jenkins reads this file every time you run the pipeline.

➡️ The Jenkinsfile must be stored in your GitHub repository.

Example repo:

myproject/
 ├── src/
 ├── Jenkinsfile

🚀 2. What is a Jenkins Pipeline?

A Pipeline is a set of steps that Jenkins runs in order.

Think of Pipeline as:

➡️ A series of stages
➡️ Each stage contains steps
➡️ Jenkinsfile describes this pipeline

Example pipeline stages:

Checkout (pull code from GitHub)

Build

Test

Deploy

🚀 3. Structure of a Pipeline (Simple Explanation)

A Jenkins Pipeline looks like this:

pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Stage Name') {
            steps {
                // commands
            }
        }
    }
}


✔ pipeline {} → tells Jenkins this is a pipeline
✔ agent any → run on any Jenkins machine
✔ stages {} → container for all major steps
✔ stage {} → one phase of the pipeline (build/test/deploy)
✔ steps {} → commands you want to run

🚀 4. How to Write a Pipeline Program (Simple Examples)
✅ Example 1: Very Simple Pipeline
pipeline {
    agent any
    
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building your project...'
            }
        }
        
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Running tests...'
            }
        }
        
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying application...'
            }
        }
    }
}

Explanation:

Build stage → prints “Building your project”

Test stage → prints “Running tests”

Deploy stage → prints “Deploying application”

This is the simplest pipeline.

✅ Example 2: Running Linux Commands
pipeline {
    agent any
    
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'echo Hello from Linux!'
                sh 'ls -l'
            }
        }
    }
}


sh → runs shell commands

You can run any Linux command here

✅ Example 3: Pipeline for a Java Maven Project
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Checkout Code') {
            steps {
                checkout scm
            }
        }

        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn clean package'
            }
        }

        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }
    }
}

✅ Example 4: Pipeline for Python
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Install Requirements') {
            steps {
                sh 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
            }
        }
        
        stage('Run Script') {
            steps {
                sh 'python app.py'
            }
        }
    }
}
