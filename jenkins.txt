->Jenkins is an automation tool mainly used for:

CI (Continuous Integration) → automatically building and testing code after every change

CD (Continuous Delivery/Deployment) → automatically releasing your software

Running scripts, jobs, pipelines, and automation tasks

-> Simple Understanding

Think of Jenkins like a robot that runs tasks for you automatically.

->Example:
If you are a developer and push code to GitHub, Jenkins can automatically:
 1.Pull the latest code
 2.Build that code
 3.Test it
 4.Deploy it to a server

->Jenkins can be installed through native system packages, Docker, or even run standalone by any machine with a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed

->Where is Jenkins Pipeline code (Jenkinsfile) saved?

This is a VERY common doubt, and here is the clear answer:

✔️ If your project uses GitHub / GitLab / Bitbucket:

The Jenkinsfile is saved inside your project's repository.

Example Git project structure:

myproject/
├── src/
├── config/
└── Jenkinsfile


So the Jenkinsfile lives in your GitHub repo.

Whenever you edit the pipeline in Blue Ocean, Jenkins commits changes to your GitHub repo automatically.

✔️ Local location (On your machine)

If you cloned the repo:

~/projects/myproject/Jenkinsfile

✔️ Jenkins DOES NOT store pipeline code internally

Jenkins only reads the Jenkinsfile from your Git repo.
It does not permanently save pipeline code inside the Jenkins server.

🧠 Why is Jenkinsfile stored in Git?

Because:

It becomes part of your application code

You can track changes

Developers can update it

It works with CI/CD best practices
